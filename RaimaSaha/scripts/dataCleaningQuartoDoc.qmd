Reading in the data

```{r}
getwd()

filename <- "data/2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data_20240721.csv"

data <- read.csv(filename)

head(data)
```

Some exploratory data analysis

```{r}
str(data)
```

At a glance: data inconsistencies

-   FIX COLUMN NAMES
    -   get rid of periods
    -   latitude and longitudes are together in character form
        -   separate into "latitude" and "longitude" columns
-   lots of Booleans are represented as characters instead of Boolean
-   fur color is either empty or inconsistent
    -   i.e. "Gray" and "Gray+"
-   dates are weird
-   many columns are character datatypes when they should be numeric or Booleans

```{r}
summary(data)
```
